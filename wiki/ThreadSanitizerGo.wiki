= Data Race Detector for Go language =

The race detector is currently integrated into the Go trunk. It works for linux/amd64 and darwin/amd64.

Just add -race flag to go test/run/install:
{{{
go test -race net/http
}}}

If the tool finds a data race it prints the report like this:
{{{

Currently the tool has found [http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AThreadSanitizer 27 data races] in the standard library and 60+ data races elsewhere. The tool significantly slowdowns programs (~2-10x) and has high memory overhead (~5-10x).
