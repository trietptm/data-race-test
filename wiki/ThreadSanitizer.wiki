= Introduction =

*!ThreadSanitizer* (aka *tsan*, *not* "Thread Sanitizer") is a data race detector for C/C++ programs. <BR>
The Linux and Mac versions are based on [http://www.valgrind.org Valgrind]. <BR>
The Windows version is based on [http://www.pintool.org PIN]. <BR>
!ThreadSanitizer is similar to [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html Helgrind] in many ways, but it also has several 
[ThreadSanitizerVsOthers differences]. <BR>
The instrumentation code is partially taken from Helgrind; 
the [ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm race detection machinery] is new (the code is written in C++). <BR>
The source code is published under BSD-like licence (except for valgrind-related modules which are GPLv2+).

!ThreadSanitizer is being actively developed and used at [http://www.google.com Google].

=How to get=
You may download the pre-built binaries from the ThreadSanitizerBuildBot

If you want to build ThreadSanitizer youself, refer to BuildingThreadSanitizer.

ThreadSanitizer is supported on the following platforms: 
  * Linux x86_64 and x86. Tested on Ubuntu 8.04 and 9.10. 
  * Darwin i386 (MacOS X 10.5).
  * Windows i386 (Tested on 7, Vista and XP)
  * In progress:
     * ARM Linux

=Using !ThreadSanitizer=
===on Linux and Mac===
Just like any other valgrind-based tool: 
{{{
valgrind [valgrind options] --tool=tsan [--tsan-options] your/program [program options]
}}}
or (if you are using the self-contained binary):
{{{
tsan.sh [--tsan-options] your/program [program options]
}}}
===on Windows===
Run ThreadSanitizer like this (assuming you unpacked it in *C:\*):
{{{
C:\tsan-x86-windows\tsan.bat [--tsan-options] -- your\program.exe [program options]
}}}

= Command line flags = 
|| Flag name || default || description ||
|| *Analysis sensitivity flags:* ||     || ThreadSanitizer can work in different modes that affect accuracy (number of detected bugs, number of false reports) and speed.||
|| --keep-history=0|1          || 1   ||  Keep the history of the previous accesses. By default, the stack traces of concurrent accesses are _almost_ precise. <BR> Setting this option to zero will make the tool run 10%-30% faster, but the concurrent accesses will not be printed. <BR> Use --keep-history=0 in continuous builds, and --keep-history=1 when analyzing reports. ||
||  --hybrid=yes|no || no  || Act as a hybrid detector (PureHappensBeforeVsHybrid) ||
||  --free-is-write=yes|no || no  || Treat `free()/delete/...` as a memory access (write), thus reporting races between `free()` and other memory accesses. *On by default since r2273*  ||
||        *Interface flags:*     ||     || Flags that affect the generated output. ||
||  --log-file=filename        ||  "" || Dump the output to `filename`; if empty dump to `stderr`||
||  --color                      ||  no || Add colors to the output using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code ANSI escape codes]. ||
||  --show-pc                    || no  || Show pc (program counter) in the stack traces. ||
||  --announce-threads           || no  || Show the stack traces of thread creation . ||
||  --fullpath-after=file_prefix || ||   Remove `"^.*file_prefix"` from the printed file names.  You may pass this flag several times. ||
|| *Resource usage* || || ||
|| --max-sid ||8388608 (2^23) || This number of unique Segment IDs. <BR> This reflects the amount of memory allocated by !ThreadSanitizer at startup. One Segment ID requires ~100 bytes of memory, so by default approximately 800M of memory is allocated.<BR> The higher this number the better. This number can not be very small (<100000). The upper bound depends on the amount of available memory.  ||
|| --num-callers || 12 || The size of the stack trace printed for the current access. Increasing this number does not affect performance. ||
|| --num-callers-in-history || 10 || The size of the stack trace stored for the concurrent accesses. <br> Increasing this number improves the reports but increases the memory footprint and slows down the execution. ||
|| *Profiling* || || ||
|| --sample-events=N || 0 ||  If non zero, !ThreadSanitizer will sample one of 2^N events and at the end print the event profile. <br> This options could be used together with ThreadSanitizerIgnores. ||
