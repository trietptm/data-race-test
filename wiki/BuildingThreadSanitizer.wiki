#summary Build instructions for ThreadSanitizer

=Valgrind-based version= 

!ThreadSanitizer is not a part of the official valgrind distribution, so you will 
have to download valgrind and !ThreadSanitizer separately. You will also have to 
apply a small patch to valgrind. 

To build both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of ThreadSanitizer on Ubuntu Lucid 64-bit, you will need to first install several additional packages:
{{{
apt-get install subversion automake libc6-dev-i386 libc6-dbg g++-multilib
}}}

Then, just run the [http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tsan/get_and_build_tsan.sh  ./get_and_build_tsan.sh script] in your terminal window.

{{{
wget http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tsan/get_and_build_tsan.sh  && \
  chmod +x ./get_and_build_tsan.sh && \
  ./get_and_build_tsan.sh `pwd`/tsan_inst_tmp
}}}

*Note:* valgrind crashes if linked using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(linker) gold] (see [https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193413 bug])
{{{
valgrind: mmap(0x400000, 241664) failed in UME with error 22 (Invalid argument).
valgrind: this can be caused by executables with very large text, data or bss segments.
}}}
Please make sure you don't use gold as a linker before building ThreadSanitizer.
