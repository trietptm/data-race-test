# Introduction #

The purpose of this tool is to apply ThreadSanitizer to programs written in Java.

# Experimental offline detector based on java.lang.instrument #
**This is a prototype**

Race detection consists of two parts:
  * Running a Java program in a special 'instrumented' mode. This generates a text file  (one for each process) containing program events.
  * Running ThreadSanitizerOffline on the generated file


## Run tests on a 64bit Linux machine ##
**Important**: Since [r128](http://code.google.com/p/java-thread-sanitizer/source/detail?r=128) jtsan doesn't support 32bit tsan\_offline. Please, use 64bit tsan\_offline.
```
# Checkout offline ThreadSanitizer _and_ the java instrumentation agent.
svn checkout http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ data-race-test
cd data-race-test
TOPDIR=`pwd`
# Build the ThreadSanitizer offline detector.
cd $TOPDIR/tsan
make l64d GTEST_ROOT= VALGRIND_ROOT= 
# Build the instrumentation agent and tests.
cd $TOPDIR/third_party/java-thread-sanitizer
ant download
ant
# Run tests.
ant test
```
If you are lucky, you will get something like this:

```
test:
     [echo] tsan offline path = ../../tsan/bin/amd64-linux-debug-ts_offline
     [exec] log
     [exec] PASS noLockWWInt
     [exec] PASS noLockWWShort
     [exec] PASS noLockWWChar
     [exec] PASS noLockWWLong
     [exec] PASS noLockWWFloat
     [exec] PASS noLockWWDouble
     ...
     ...
     ...
     [exec] PASS reentrantLockSimple
     [exec] PASS tryLock2
     [exec] PASS atomicInteger
     [exec] EXCL hashSetAccessNoLocks          Reason: HashSet loads before instrumenting start
     [exec] EXCL lockInBetween                 Reason: Tsan finds inexact happens-before arc
     [exec] EXCL staticVolatileBoolean         Reason: We handle volatile fields in super classes incorrectly
     [exec] EXCL superClassVolatile            Reason: We handle volatile fields in super classes incorrectly
     [exec] EXCL syncWithStaticVolatile        Reason: We handle volatile fields in super classes incorrectly
     [exec] EXCL joinWithoutStart              Reason: Incorrect handling of join() in Agent
     [exec] 
     [exec] ----
     [exec] passed: 43, failed: 0, excluded: 6, total: 49
```

You can view all logs in $TOPDIR/third\_party/java-thread-sanitizer/log directory.

## Run Tests manually ##
In success case, after 'ant download' and 'ant' tasks you have two jars in dist/ directory: agent.jar  tests.jar
You can run tests.jar like any other java application under jtsan. And then run tsan offline.
```
java -Xbootclasspath/p:dist/agent.jar -javaagent:dist/agent.jar=logfile=events -jar dist/tests.jar
$TOPDIR/tsan/bin/amd64-linux-debug-ts_offline <events
```

# Implementation notes #

## Definitions ##
  * **TID** (thread id) -- a 32-bit integer identifying a thread. The TID of the first (main) thread is 0, the TID of the 2-nd thread is 1 and so on. TIDs are not reused.
  * **PC** -- a 64-bit integer which identifies a position in the Java byte code. There should be an external mechanism to match a PC to `{ClassName, RoutineName, FileName, FileLineNumber}`.
  * **ID** -- a 64-bit integer identifying an object in memory. TODO(kcc): there are several ways to general such IDs, list them.



## Event syntax ##
For the first protoype we propose to dump the events in a simple text form.

Each event is a 5-tuple: `EVENT_NAME TID PC A B`.
The events generated by the instrumented Java program would be:

Read and write events:
  * `READ  TID PC ID SIZE`
  * `WRITE TID PC ID SIZE`
`SIZE` is rudimentary for Java and could always be 1.

Routine call/enter/exit:
  * `RTN_CALL  TID PC 0 0`
  * `RTN_ENTER TID PC 0 0`
  * `RTN_EXIT  TID PC 0 0 `
An alternative to a pair `RTN_CALL/RTN_ENTER` would be to have
  * `RTN_CALL  TID PC TARGET_PC 0`

Memory allocation:
  * `MALLOC TID PC ID SIZE`

Thread events:
  * `THR_CREATE TID PC CHILD_TID 0`
  * `THR_START  TID PC 0 0`
  * `THR_END    TID PC 0 0`
  * `THR_JOIN   TID PC JOINED_THREAD_TID 0`

Lock events:
  * `LOCK   TID PC ID 0`
  * `UNLOCK TID PC ID 0`

Events generated by `notify()` and `wait()`
  * `SIGNAL TID PC ID 0`
  * `WAIT   TID PC ID 0`
